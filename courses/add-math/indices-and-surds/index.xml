      <description>Big Numbers In a previous session we encountered this puzzle of an author on the way to St Ives, when he sees 7 wives on the way, each carrying 7 sacks, each with 7 cats, each with 7 kittens. And we found that the total number of kittens were 7 x 7 x 7 x 7 = 2401 kittens. Those many kittens would be hard to manage, but the number itself easily manageable.</description>

      <description>First lets revisit the definition of exponentiation:
 Defn: Exponentiation is simply repeated application of multiplication. Given a postive number \(a\) and a positive integer \(m\), we define \(a^m\) (pronounced &amp;ldquo;a power m&amp;rdquo;) simply as:
$$ a^m = \underbrace{a \times a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_{m\text{ times}} $$
   Note that we are starting with both \( a \) and \( m \) as positive integers. As we go along, we will expand the realm of applicability of the exponentiation operation.</description>

      <description>Working with Surds Most textbook chapters on Surds cover the regular problems using the rules that pertain to addition, subtraction, mulitplication and division of surds, and of course, the most common of them all, rationalizing the denominator. We will only briefly touch upon these here, before moving on to some more interesting learnings on surds:
 Addition/Subtraction of surds:  When an integer and a surd are added/subtracted, there is no more simplifcation possible: $$2 \pm \sqrt{3}$$ When two different surds are added/subtracted, there is no more simplifcation possible: $$ \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$$ When two similar surds are added/subtracted, the result cab be simplified as follows: $$ \sqrt{5} + 3\sqrt{5} = 4\sqrt{5}$$ $$ \sqrt[3]{5} - 4\sqrt[3]{5} = -3\sqrt[3]{5}$$  Multiplication/Division of surds:  When an integer and a surd are multiplied/divided, there is no more simplifcation possible: $$2 \sqrt{3} \text{ , } \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}$$ When two surds of the same n-th root but different bases are multiplied/divided, the result can be simplified as follows: $$ \sqrt{2} \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{2.</description>
