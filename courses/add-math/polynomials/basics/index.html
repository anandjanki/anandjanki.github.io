  <h1>Basics</h1>
  

<p>We have looked at linear functions, f(x) = ax + b \), quadratic functions of the form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), and even cubic functions of the form \( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \). All these functions belong to a class of functions commonly known as polynomials. It should be easy to guess that a <em>quartic function</em> would follow the cubic function in the same pattern.</p>

<p>These are all listed below:</p>

<p class="katex">
  $$
\begin{array}{rclcl}
\text{Linear} & : & f(x) = ax + b \\
\text{Quadratic} & : & f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\
\text{Cubic} & : & f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\
\text{Quartic} & : & f(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e \\
\end{array}
$$
</p>


<p>To generalize these kinds of function, we notice that using \( a, b, c\ldots \) for the coefficients gets cumbersome. So, we switch over to numbered coefficients to have the following definition.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>














<table id=Defn&#32;1: class="w-100 collapse">
<tr>
<th class="bt bl bb w-10  pv3 v-top">Defn 1:</th>
<td class="bb ph2 "><p>A polynomial function (simply called a <strong>polynomial</strong>) is a function of the form:</p>

<p class="katex">
  $$ p(x) = a_n\cdot x^n + a_{n-1}\cdot x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1\cdot x + a_0 $$
</p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li>\(n \) is a whole number,</li>
<li>the domain of the function is \( \R \) (which means \( x\) takes real values),</li>
<li>the coefficients are fixed real numbers, i.e. \(a_i \in \R, i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n \), with at least \( a_n \ne 0 \),</li>
<li>the co-domain of the function therefore is also \( \R \) (which means \(p(x)\) takes real values).</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>It may be noted that we have intently defined a polynomial with a single variable \( x\) for our purposes, these are called univariate polynomials, a more general definition would be multivariate polynomials, for e.g., \( f(x,y) = x^3 + xy^2 + 4xy + 10 \).</p>

<p>It may also be noted that we have intently defined the coefficients to be real numbers, a more general definition would have allowed for complex numbers as coefficients. We could also define polynomials where we allow only for say rational coefficients, or say only the set of integers \( {0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9} \) which are all the remainders upon division by 10, but we stick to real numbers for our purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, it may also be noted that we have intently defined the domain to be real numbers, a more general definition would have allowed for complex numbers as the domain for the function.</p>

<p>We can now re-write the list of functions we had earlier as follows:</p>

<p class="katex">
  $$
\begin{array}{rclcl}
\text{Constant} & : & f(x) = a_0 \\
\text{Linear} & : & f(x) = a_0 + a_1x \\
\text{Quadratic} & : & f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 \\
\text{Cubic} & : & f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 \\
\text{Quartic} & : & f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + a_4x^4 \\
\end{array}
$$
</p>


<p>Note that we have also used the general definition to say that a <em>constant function</em> also falls in the same category.</p>

<h2 id="degree-and-roots">Degree and Roots</h2>

<p>Another definition, rather terminology, used very commonly with polynomials is the following:













<table id=Defn&#32;2: class="w-100 collapse">
<tr>
<th class="bt bl bb w-10  pv3 v-top">Defn 2:</th>
<td class="bb ph2 ">The <strong>degree</strong> of a polynomial is the highest index of the variable \( x\) in the polynomial.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Thus, the degree of a cubic polynomial, \( f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 \), is obviously \(3\). Note that the degree of the constant polynomial is \(0\).</p>

<p>Since a polynomial is also a function, the roots of a polynomial has the same meaning as the roots of a function. A root of a polynomial (also called zero of the function) is a member \( x\) of the domain where the polynomial vanishes.</p>

<p>For e.g., for a given polynomial, say \( p(x) = x^3 - 1.25x^2 - 4.135x + 4.73 \), if we know that say \( p(2.15) = 0 \), then \( 2.15 \) is called a root of the polynomial. You can also check that this polynomial has two more roots, \( p(1.1) = 0\) and \( p(-2) = 0 \), hence \( 1.1 \) and \( -2\) are also roots of the polynomial.</p>

<p>As for any other function, we can draw the graph of this polynomial function as shown below.</p>

<div class="book-columns flex justify-between">

</div>



<h3 id="graphs-of-polynomials">Graphs of polynomials</h3>

<p>There is a very interesting relationship between the degree of a polynomial and the number of roots it has. To see this, first lets visualize the graphs of a few example polynomials of different degrees.</p>

<div class="book-columns flex justify-between">

            <h4>Polynomial of degree 0: f(x) = 2</h4>

</figure>
  </div>
  
</div>



<p>Next, lets count the number of roots for each of the polynomials above. The polynomial of degeee 0 has 0 roots, the polynomial of degree 1 has 1 root, the polynomial of degree 2 has 2 roots, the polynomial of degree 3 has 3 roots, and so on. If you are a little hasty, you may jump to the conlusion that the number of roots of a polynomial is the same as the degree of the polynomial. But that would not be the case.</p>

<p>Look carefully at the polynomial of degree 5 above. It does not have 5 roots, in fact it seems to have 3 roots only. The graph of this polynomial is plotted again below as \( p_1(x)\), but plotted alongside are two other polynomials which are just shifted up / down from this polynomial.
<div class="book-columns flex justify-between">
  

  
  
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  

  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b10 ">

  <div class="flex-1 flex-b10 ">
    
  </div>
  
</div>

</p>

<p>Notice how the polynomial \( p_1(x)\) has 3 roots as was also seen before. The other polynomial \( p_2(x) \) which is plotted in blue and is just \( p_1\) shifted up by 3, i.e. \( p_2(x) = p_1(x) + 3 \) has only 1 root. The third polynomial \( p_3(x) \) which is plotted in green and is just \( p_1\) shifted down by 3, i.e. \( p_2(x) = p_1(x) - 3 \) and has 5 roots.</p>

<h3 id="repeated-roots">Repeated Roots</h3>

<p>Before we proceed further, it is important to note that a polynomial may have repeated roots. It is of course not necessary that all the roots of a polynomial should be distinct.</p>

<p>For e.g., the polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 \) has two real roots, but both the roots are the same, namely \( x = 0\), i.e., the polynomial has one repeated root, and this root itself is repeated twice.</p>

<p>Shown below are examples of a few polynomials, all of degree 5, with repeated roots.</p>

</div>



<h3 id="end-behavior">End Behavior</h3>

<p>In order to understand these graphs better, we need to look into what is called the end behavior of these polynomial functions.</p>

<p>End behavior simply means the sign of the function (whether it is positive or negative) when the x-value is at extremes ends of the domain. Since the domain of our polynomial functions is \( \R \), end behavior means the sign that the function has when \( x \to +\infty \) and when \( x \to -\infty \).</p>

<p>Lets take a few examples to understand this better:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Consider a polynomial function with an even degree, say \( y = x^2 \). When \( x \to +\infty \), clearly y also becomes very large and importantly \( y &gt; 0 \). Likewise, when \( x \to -\infty \), y again becomes very large and interestingly, stays positive, as \( x \to -\infty, y &gt; 0 \).
<div class="book-columns flex justify-between">
  

  
  
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  

  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b20 ">
    
  </div>
  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b60 ">
    <figure class="figs">
    <img src="images/q-large-3.png"/> 
</figure>
  </div>
  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b20 ">
    
  </div>
  
</div>

</p></li>

<li><p>You may say, lets add a negative value to the function, lets consider \( y = x^2 - 10000 \).  For small values of \( x\), in and around \( x = 0\), the function is indeed negative. For e.g., \( f(10) = 10^2 - 10000 = -9900 \), and \( f(-20) = (-20)^2 - 10000 = -9600\). But if we take a large enough value of \(x\), say \( x = 400 \) or \( x = -300 \), it is easy to see that the value of the function is positive.
<div class="book-columns flex justify-between">
  

  
  
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  

  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b20 ">

  <div class="flex-1 flex-b60 ">

</figure>
  </div>
  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b20 ">
    
  </div>
  
</div>

</p></li>

<li><p>You may say next, lets add more negativity to the function, lets consider \( y = x^2 - 1,000,000x - 200,000,000,000 \). But it doesnt matter. Of course, for small value of \(x\), the function would be negative. But if we take very large values of \(x\), say \( x = 10,000,000 \) or \( x = -10,000,000 \), the function remains positive.
<div class="book-columns flex justify-between">
  

  
  
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  

  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b20 ">
    
  </div>
  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b60 ">

  </div>
  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b20 ">
    
  </div>
  
</div>

</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, the insight we get from these graphs is that it does not matter what the smaller terms of the polynomial are, the highest degree term dominates the sign of the function at very large values of x.</p>

<p>In all of the above, we have considered the highest degree term with a positive sign. If we were to consider the function \( y = -x^2 \), then, we can easily see that when \( x \to \infty \), then the function is negative, and likewise when \( x \to -\infty \).</p>

<p>This property also holds no matter what the degree of the polynomial. So, if we consider a polynomial of degree 3, a cubic polynomial, the same would hold true. The highest degree term would control the sign of the function at extreme values of x.</p>

<p>Polynomial functions with an odd degree behave slightly differently from even functions though in the following manner. For an odd degree polynomial, for e.g. say, \( y = x^3 - 10x^2 - 100x - 1000 \), for a large positive value of \( x \), say \( x = 100 \), or even just \(x = 30 \), the sign of this polynomial is positive, and for a negative value of \( x\), say \( x = -20 \), the sign of this polynomial is negative. Thus, as \( x \to \infty\), \( y &gt; 0 \), and as \( x \to -\infty \), \( y &lt; 0\). This is shown in the graph below.</p>

<div class="book-columns flex justify-between">
  

  
  
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  
    
      
      
    
  

  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b20 ">
    
  </div>
  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b60 ">
    <figure class="figs">
    <img src="images/c-large-1.png"/> 
</figure>
  </div>
  
  <div class="flex-1 flex-b20 ">
    
  </div>
  
</div>



<p>We can prove this end behavior of polynomials (somewhat informally) as follows:</p>

<p>Consider,
<p class="katex">
  $$ p(x) = a_n\cdot x^n + a_{n-1}\cdot x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1\cdot x + a_0 $$
</p>

We can re-write \(p(x) \) as follows:
<p class="katex">
  $$ p(x) = a_n\cdot x^n\cdot r(x) $$
</p>

where,
<p class="katex">
  $$ r(x) =  \frac{a_0}{a_n}\cdot\frac{1}{x^n} + \frac{a_1}{a_n}\cdot\frac{1}{x^{n-1}} + \cdots + \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\cdot\frac{1}{x} + 1 $$
</p>

Now, when \(x\) becomes very large negative or very large positive values, it can be seen that the above function \(r(x) \) will be almost equal to 1. This is written formally as,
<p class="katex">
  $$ \lim_{x\to \infty}r(x) = 1 $$
</p>

In English, <em>in the limit</em> as \(x\) tends towards \(\infty\), \(r(x)\) tends to \(1\). Likewise, as \( x \to -\infty \),
<p class="katex">
  $$ \lim_{x\to -\infty}r(x) = 1 $$
</p>

In other words, at the extreme values of \(x\), the value of the polynomial is dominated and thus its sign determined by the term \(a_n \cdot x^n\). This leads us to the following scenarios:</p>

<h3 id="how-many-roots">How many roots</h3>

<p>We are finally in a position to see how the number of roots of a polynomial is related to its degree. Lets state the result.</p>

<p>An even degree real polynomial (domain is \( \R \)) and coefficients are also from \( \R \) has an even number of real roots, it can be 0 or 2 or any even number \( \leq \) the degree of the polynomial.</p>

<p>An odd degree real polynomial has an odd number of real roots, it can be 1 or 3 or any odd number \( \leq \) the degree of the polynomial.</p>

<p>Notice how an even degree polynomial may not any real roots at all. But an odd degree polynomial will necessarily have at least 1 real root.</p>

<p>We will not prove this formally, but will simply note that this follows from the end behavior investigation we did in the previous section.</p>

<p>Lets the case of an odd degree polynomial with positive \(a_n\). We know that such a polynomial is negative as \(x \to -\infty \), and is positive as \(x \to +\infty \). Since polynomial functions are continuous functions (they dont have any breaks in them), it follows that at some point the function has to cross the x-axis from -ve values of y to +ve values of y. Hence it has at least 1 root. Suppose it crosses back to the negative side, meaning it has a second root, then it has to necessarily again cross back to the postiive side, because that is the only way it can get to positive values for \( x \to \infty \). We can make similar arguments in each of the cases above.</p>
