      <description>We have looked at linear functions, \( f(x) = ax + b \), quadratic functions of the form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), and even cubic functions of the form \( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \). All these functions belong to a class of functions commonly known as polynomials. It should be easy to guess that a quartic function would follow the cubic function in the same pattern.</description>

      <description>Note - This topic is not in the syllabus of IGCSE Additional Mathematics curriculum. But is an interesting topic nevertheless that learners can explore if interested.
While finding the roots of a polynomial is an involved activity, doing the opposite turns out to be fairly simple. If we are given the roots of a polynomial, can we construct the polynomial back from it?
To keep it simple, we will restrict ourselves to real rools, and in fact to polynomials for whome all the roots of the polynomial are real.</description>
