      <description>Going to St Ives We start with a counting riddle in the form of an English-language nursery rhyme from the 1700s. The poem goes as follows:
 As I was going to St Ives,
Upon the road I met seven wives;
Every wife had seven sacks,
Every sack had seven cats,
Every cat had seven kits:
Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
How many were going to St Ives?
 There are many ways to answer this question.</description>
