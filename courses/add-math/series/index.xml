      <description>Basic Mathematical Operations We have come a long way as human beings exploring mathematical operations. We will take a quick refresher here before getting into the binomial theorem.
Addition We started of course with the addition operation, starting with the addition of natural numbers, like 3 and 2 as shown in the pic1 below:
 3 &amp;#43; 2 = 5   In pioneering research conducted by psychologist Karen Wynn in 1990s, she reported that five-month-old human infants are able to compute the outcomes of simple addition and subtraction operations on small sets of physical objects.</description>

      <title>Sequences and Series</title>

      <description>Why study sequences? Sequences have been interesting to humans for a long time because of the patterns they hide within them. Just the discovery of these patterns have given us immense joy. An added advantage of discovering and describing a pattern is the ability to predict the future. A classic example is the discovery of the pattern of the Halley&amp;rsquo;s comet, and the prediction of its next observation. Imagine the surprise and joy that would have accompanied when over 250 years ago, the comet was spotted as predicted by Edmund Halley in 1758.</description>

      <description>AP basics  Defn 1: An Arithmetic Progression (or an AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between consecutive terms is a constant.   Examples Here are a few examples of APs:
 The sequence of odd natural numbers which is simply - \( (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots ) \) - is an AP, because the difference between any two consecutive terms is \(2\).</description>

      <description>GP basics  Defn 1: A Geometric Progression (or a GP) is a sequence of numbers such that the ratio between consecutive terms is a constant.   Note that the constant can be a positive natural number (such as 10), or a fractional number (such as 1&amp;frasl;2 or 0.25, etc), or even a negative number (such as -2).
Examples Here are a few examples of APs:
 The sequence of powers of two which is simply - \( (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots ) \) - is a GP, because the ratio between any two consecutive terms is \(2\).</description>
