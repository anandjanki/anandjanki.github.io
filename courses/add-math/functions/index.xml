      <description>In a class of 20 learners, 5 of them have taken History, 10 of them have taken English and 15 of them have taken Math!! Do you think this is an impossible statement, or is it possible to have class of only 20 learners where all the conditions above are satisfied? What if we are posed an additional question - what is the maximum number of learners who may not have taken any of these three subjects?</description>

      <description>Definition Now that we have looked at sets in fair amount of detail, we can start doing some interesting math when we take two sets and start relating the elements in one set to the elements in the other.
 Defn 1: A Mapping is simply a rule that connects elements of one set to the elements of another set.   Note that implicit in the defintion is notion of a first set whose elements are connected to the elements on the other set, the second set.</description>
