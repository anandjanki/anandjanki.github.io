      <description>In a class of 20 learners, 5 of them have taken History, 10 of them have taken English and 15 of them have taken Math!! Do you think this is an impossible statement, or is it possible to have class of only 20 learners where all the conditions above are satisfied? What if we are posed an additional question - what is the maximum number of learners who may not have taken any of these three subjects?</description>

      <description>Definition Now that we have looked at sets in fair amount of detail, we can start doing some interesting math when we take two sets and start relating the elements in one set to the elements in the other.
 Defn 1: A Mapping is simply a rule that connects elements of one set to the elements of another set.   Note that implicit in the defintion is notion of a first set whose elements are connected or mapped to the elements on the other set, the second set.</description>

      <description>We have now covered all the background needed to delve into one of the most fundamental topics of Mathematics - we are now ready to understand what functions are. Almost every other session we do in the course of Additional Mathematics will build on this topic, so it is essential that you go through all the background we covered so far (that on Sets and Mappings and carefully understand the concept of functions described in great detail here.</description>

      <title>EC Problems</title>

      <description>EC problems may not always be easy problems. They are actually extra-curricular problems.. :) They usually add some interesting facets to the topic under discussion, some fascinating discoveries, etc. But they are usually not from the board syllabus for the topic. (As always, once you read a problem, take some time to attempt it yourself, if you need help, take a peek at the &amp;ldquo;Hint&amp;rdquo; section, then again attempt to solve it yourself, feel free to check the &amp;ldquo;Answer&amp;rdquo; section if you want to check the answer you found, or even just get a feel for the magnitude of the answer.</description>
