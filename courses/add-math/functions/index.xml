      <description>In a class of 20 learners, 5 of them have taken History, 10 of them have taken English and 15 of them have taken Math!! Do you think this is an impossible statement, or is it possible to have class of only 20 learners where all the conditions above are satisfied? What if we are posed an additional question - what is the maximum number of learners who may not have taken any of these three subjects?</description>
