      <description>Geometry Sessions Geometry is a standard subject in regular high school Mathematics unlike Number Theory which is usually not covered in regular school curriculums. So, what we will do in these EC Math (Extra-curricular Math) sessions in Geometry will draw upon standard topics we learn in school and go beyond to find some very interesting results and discoveries.
Geometry is also one of the oldest fields of Mathematics, the other being the study of numbers or Arithmetic and Number Theory.</description>
